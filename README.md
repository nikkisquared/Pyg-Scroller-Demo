Pyg Scroller Demo
=================
Pyg Scroller Demo is an approach to creating a 2D world that can be explored, built on pygcurse and pygame. It features an image converter that creates a CSV map tile file, a shape creator, and an interpreter for hard-coded pixels. Pyg Scroller Demo's greatest strength is the delightful and subtle combinations of foreground and background colours, as well as minimalist ASCII art.

Usage
=====
Requires python 2, pygame, and pygcurse (please get pygcurse from here: https://github.com/asweigart/pygcurse).  
python runme.py

History
=======
Pyg Scroller Demo was originally created in early 2013, with two possible project ideas it could lead to. Neither of them came about, but I think it's still a cool demo, if unwieldly to add more to.
